# hello-world
My first repository to help me learn how to use GitHub!

About me:
When comtemplating existence in the holodeck otherwise know as "The Universe," I occasionally experience feelings of fear, uncertainty and even indifference. In these times, I find that the mutualistic practices of coding and design help to soothe these, I would argue, completely rational thoughts from obscuring what would otherwise be quite a lovely simulation! Thus... HELLO WORLD!
